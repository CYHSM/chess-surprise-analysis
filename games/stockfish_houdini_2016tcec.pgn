advantage can be converted into a win in a game between Stockfish and Houdini,
or in a correspondence game, is an open question, but for those of us
concerned with practical play over the board White's pull may be something to
work with. } ) 19... g4 20. Nc5 ( 20. Re1 ) ( 20. Rg8 ) 20... O-O-O 21. dxe6 Nxe6 22. Nxd7 Nxd7 23. Rxd8+ Nxd8 24. Bxc4 { White has an advantage, but Black held. } 24... Ne5 25. Bb3 b5 26.

White has a bit more space and an initiative thanks to its lead in development,
but it's not yet clearly enough to win. So now we're treated to a technical
master class complementing the tactical show we've just seen. } 21... Nd8 { Blocking
the 8th rank so the bishop and rook can develop. } 22. Rh7 Kf8 23. Ne4 Bd7 24. g4 { Intending if necessary to play Nf6 and g5, cementing a huge space
advantage on the kingside. This also prevents Black from using his (its) pawn
majority, so only White will be able to create a passed pawn later on. } 24... Bb5 25. c4 Bc6 26. Kd2 { Bringing the last piece into play. Don't forget that one of
the typical marks of an ending is the ability to use the piece as part of the
army, and not to keep his majesty hidden away. } ( 26. Nf6 { is also strong. } ) 26... Bxe4 { Clearing the way for further development, but the bishop vs.
knight imbalance just transforms White's advantage from one sort to another. } ( 26... Ke7 ) 27. Bxe4 Kg8 28. Rh1 f5 { Grabbing space and potentially making it
easier for Black to eventually create a kingside passer. } 29. gxf5 gxf5 30. Bf3 Rc8 31. Kc3 Rc7 ( 31... b5 32. b3 { only helps White create a passed pawn. } ) 32. b4 Kg7 33. c5 Re7 ( 33... Nf7 { is an another way to try to achieve ...e5,
leaving the rook on c7 where it holds up White's queenside advance. Against

quick line to demonstrate: } 36... f4 37. Kd4 $5 ( 37. Kd3 f3 38. Ke3 Rf5 39. Ke4 Rf8 40. Rf1 f2 41. e6 Kg6 42. Ke5 { is simpler, but the main line is instructive in
its own right. } ) 37... f3 38. e6 $5 ( 38. Ke3 ) ( 38. Rf1 ) 38... Rf5 39. Ke4 Kf6 40. Rh6+ Kg7 41. e7 $1 ( 41. Kxf5 $1 Kxh6 42. e7 f2 43. e8=Q f1=Q+ 44. Ke6 Qe1+ 45. Kd7 $1 Qxb4 46. Qe3+ Kg6 47.

endings are sometimes extraordinarily difficult to win, this one will be a
snap. The only critical looking line is } 47... Qf4+ 48. Qe5 Qxb4 49. Kc7 a5 50. Qf6+ Kh5 51. Qb6 { when White wins: the b-pawn will fall, the c-pawn will advance,
and Black has no serious shot at a perpetual, thanks in part to the
interference on the a-file caused by his own pawn. } ) 34. Rg1+ Kf8 35. Rd1 Nf7 36. Bh5 Kg7 ( 36... e5 37. Rd5 $1 Kg7 ( 37... exf4 38. Rxf5 Kg7 39. Rxf4 $18 ) 38. Bxf7 Kxf7 39. fxe5 f4 40. Rd4 Rxe5 41. Rxf4+ Ke6 42. Rd4 $1 { This is a
critical resource, preventing Black's king from joining his pawns. If the king
could reach c7, the resulting ending would be drawn (provided of course that
the rooks are still on the board; the king and pawn ending would be dead won
for White). } ) 37. Rg1+ Kf8 38. a4 e5 { Black finally plays his last trump. } 39. Rg6 $1 exf4 { Black is momentarily a pawn ahead, but both f-pawns will
disappear shortly, reversing the material count. } 40. Rf6 Kg7 41. Rxf5 Ne5 42. Rxf4 { It is possible that here too, Black could save the game if the king
could "teleport" to c7, though perhaps it wouldn't be so simple after White
played b4-b5. Here, however, Black has no chance. } 42... Rd7 43. Rd4 Rc7 ( 43... Rxd4 44. Kxd4 Kf6 45. b5 axb5 46. axb5 Ke6 47. Be2 $1 { Black's problem is that he's
stuck. The king must keep the knight protected, and the knight must stay put
because of Bf3, winning the b-pawn. } 47... Kf6 48. Bd1 $1 Ke6 49. Bb3+ Kf6 50. Bd5 $18 { and that's that. } ) 44. Rd6 $1 Kf8 45. Re6 Re7 { Now Black's king is close
enough in case the rooks are exchanged, but White still has one move to win. } 46. Rf6+ $1 { Driving the king away. } 46... Kg8 47. Rf5 Kg7 { Here the game was
adjudicated in White's favor. It may not seem obviously won, and humans would
and should keep playing against each other. It is easy to determine, however,
that White wins by force and without much trouble. } ( 47... Kg7 48. b5 axb5 49. axb5 Nd7 50. Kd4 Nf8 51. Bf3 Ne6+ 52. Ke5 Nf8+ ( 52... Nxc5+ 53. Kd6 $18 ) 53. Kd5 Rd7+ 54.

enough. } 58... Ke8 59. c6 Rb8 60. c7 Rc8 61. Kc6 $1 $18 { followed by b7, not even
allowing Black to struggle on in queen vs. rook. (Not that it's a struggle for
an engine, but only for a human.) } ) 1-0
